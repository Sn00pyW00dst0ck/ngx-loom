the sole purpose of easily rendering directed graph structures. \nInstallation\nTo install, utilize the npm command COMMAND HERE. \nFeatures\nngx-loom currently provides the following features: \n\nAbility to render directed (or undirected) graph structures.\nAbility to overwrite the default node and edge display styles utilizing ng-templates.\nAbility to pan and zoom the displayed graph.\nAbility to implement custom 'layouts', which allows replacing the default rendering engine.\nAbility to bind to output events raised when a graph node or edge is clicked.\nAbility to center and auto-zoom the graph utilizing exposed methods.\n\nDevelopment Setup\nTo setup for development, run the following commands within a Linux terminal. \nExample :git clone \"https://github.com/Sn00pyW00dst0ck/ng-loom.git\"\ncd ng-loom\nnpm iBuild & Run\nThere are five npm scripts available to build and run ngx-loom and its demo application. \n\nbuild:demo:dev - Builds the demo application with development configuration. \nbuild:demo:prod - Builds the demo applicaiton with production configuration.\nbuild:loom:dev - Builds the ngx-loom project with development configuration.\nbuild:loom:prod - Builds the ngx-loom project with production configuration.\nserve:demo - Serves the demo application to localhost.\n\n\n[!NOTE]\nIn order to build the demo application, first the ngx-loom project must be built. Without completing this step, building the demo application may fail. \n\nTest\nThere are four npm scripts available to test ngx-loom and its demo application. \n\ntest:demo - Runs unit tests for the demo application. \ntest:demo:headless - Runs unit tests for the demo application within headless mode. \ntest:loom - Runs unit tests for the ngx-loom project.\ntest:loom:headless - Runs unit tests for the ngx-loom project within headless mode.\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation for ngx-loom is created utilizing Compodoc. There are two provided npm scripts to generate documentation. \n\ncompodoc:build - Builds the documentation to a directory /documentation.\ncompodoc:serve - Builds and serves the documentation to localhost:5555.\n\nNote: Documentation is not generated for the loom-demo project, only ngx-loom.\n\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Component\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Directive\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    3 Classes\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    3 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            constrain   (projects/.../utils.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    projects/ngx-loom/src/lib/utils.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        constrain\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : (min: number, value: number, max: number): number => ((value = max) ? max : value)\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    Constrains a given value within a given min and max value.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
